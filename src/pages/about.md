# About Us

UBU Team was set up in response to our director finding there were limited options when accessing NDIS support in the local area. It was difficult to access everyday activities appropriate to age, life stage and intellectual capacity. It quickly became apparent that this concept was not understood by many disability providers, along with a number of other concepts identified by the NDIS.

Jaz previously worked in disability, mental health and nursing before her disability journey began in 2018 and she left work in 2019. After significant physical struggle she became an NDIS participant in 2020 and met other participants in the same situation, trying to find meaningful activities and age-appropriate recreational opportunities within the community.

After long consideration and fantastic support from those closest to her, Jaz is now driving her business for the benefit of those like her. She supports clients to achieve social inclusion in recreation, education and employment. Jaz is committed to training her staff to the highest standards to provide the highest levels of support.

As in life, business is constantly changing. We encourage our clients and staff to take part in meetings and forums to ensure UBU Team does not stagnate but keeps up to date with client needs and preferences and maintains supportive relationships with our staff.

## Vision Statement

Our vision is to raise the benchmark in the quality and delivery of disability support through education and training that clarifies many of the concepts introduced by the NDIS.

Many of these concepts are currently misunderstood or undervalued due to lack of first-hand disability experience and lack of communication with consumers.

We will also prove the value of our support staff as trained experts within their field, showing how education together with strong work ethic ensure quality, dignity and safe practices for all.
